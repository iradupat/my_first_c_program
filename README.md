# MY FIRST C PROJECT 
## Introduction
Hello world!!!

This software is the very first program I built, back in 2017 during my first programming class at university. I presented it as my class project—an assignment required to pass the **C programming** course—and I received a grade of 23 out of 25. This project now serves as a learning resource for anyone interested in starting a programming career, particularly in C programming
